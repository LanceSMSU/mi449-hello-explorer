    <h1>Earth</h1>
    <p>The planet Earth is the one we all live on and is the third planet from the Sun. Earth was formed 4.5 billion years ago from gas in the solar system. What enables Earth to be the only known astonomical object to contain life is that it is the only one that sustains water on the surface. Additionally, Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and orbits the Sun.</p>
